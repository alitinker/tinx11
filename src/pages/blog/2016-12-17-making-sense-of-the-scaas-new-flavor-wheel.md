Google made a DIY robot named Alto.

Alto thinks with the help of a Raspberry Pi Zero W. 

And Alto can see you using the camera affixed to the Raspberry Pi.

Alto learns with the help of a Coral B Accelerator. 

The software installed on the Raspberry Pi allows Alto to recall objects that have been viewed before.
